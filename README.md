**Records Project**

In this project I managed a collection of records.
Each record has a unique name, and several copies (possibly more than a single copy).
The software displays a text menu for the user and depending on the user's selection the actions will be performed. ⏭
Project planning was through main functions. And some had sub-functions (auxiliary functions) according to the identification of a particular common behavior.⏺
